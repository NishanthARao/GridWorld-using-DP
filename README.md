# Solving-GridWorld
Solving a 4x4 gridworld using Reinforcement Learning algorithms

This repository contains codes (Work in Progress) that solve the 4x4 simple gridworld example presented in the textbook "Reinforcement Learning: An introduction" by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto.

So far, the methods of Dynamic Programming and Monte Carlo methods (Exploring Starts) are implemented.
